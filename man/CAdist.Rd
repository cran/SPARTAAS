\title{
Distance matrix based on correspondence analysis results}
\description{
Run an Correspondences analysis on a contingence table then return the matrix distance of the coordinates (you can choose the number of axes to use to build the distance matrix with the nCP parameter).
}
\usage{
CAdist(df, nPC = NULL, graph = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{df}{
Data.frame, matrix or table with the data for the correspondence analysis}
  \item{nPC}{
Number of principal components to be retained for the construction of the distance matrix. Must be between 1 and the minimum of ncol - 1 and nrow - 1. Could also be "max".}
  \item{graph}{
Logical parameter for plot the Correspondences Analysis (axis1, axis2)}
}

\value{
\item{dist }{The distance matrix}
